- source_sentence: 'query: usp1-trapping lesions as a source of dna replication damage
    and genomic instability.'
  sentences:
  - 'passage: The deubiquitinase USP1 is a critical regulator of genome integrity
    through the deubiquitylation of Fanconi Anemia proteins and the DNA replication
    processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Uniquely, following
    UV irradiation, USP1 self-inactivates through autocleavage, which enables its
    own degradation and in turn, upregulates PCNA monoubiquitylation. However, the
    functional role for this autocleavage event during physiological conditions remains
    elusive. Herein, we discover that cells harboring an autocleavage-defective USP1
    mutant, while still able to robustly deubiquitylate PCNA, experience more replication
    fork-stalling and premature fork termination events. Using super-resolution microscopy
    and live-cell single-molecule tracking, we show that these defects are related
    to the inability of this USP1 mutant to be properly recycled from sites of active
    DNA synthesis, resulting in replication-associated lesions. Furthermore, we find
    that the removal of USP1 molecules from DNA is facilitated by the DNA-dependent
    metalloprotease Spartan to counteract the cytotoxicity caused by “USP1-trapping”.
    We propose a utility of USP1 inhibitors in cancer therapy based on their ability
    to induce USP1-trapping lesions and consequent replication stress and genomic
    instability in cancer cells, similar to how non-covalent DNA-protein crosslinks
    cause cytotoxicity by imposing steric hindrances upon proteins involved in DNA
    transactions.'
  - 'passage: OBJECTIVE: Neddylation is a druggable and reversible ubiquitin-like
    post-translational modification upregulated in many diseases, including liver
    fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and more recently, non-alcoholic fatty liver
    disease (NAFLD). Herein, we propose to address the effects of neddylation inhibition
    and the underlying mechanisms in pre-clinical models of NAFLD. METHODS: Hepatic
    neddylation measured by immunohistochemical analysis and NEDD8 serum levels measured
    by ELISA assay were evaluated in NAFLD clinical and pre-clinical samples. The
    effects of neddylation inhibition by using a pharmacological small inhibitor,
    MLN4924, or molecular approaches were assessed in isolated mouse hepatocytes and
    pre-clinical mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD, male adult C57BL/6 mice, and
    the AlfpCre transgenic mice infected with AAV-DIO-shNedd8. RESULTS: Neddylation
    inhibition reduced lipid accumulation in oleic acid-stimulated mouse primary hepatocytes
    and ameliorated liver steatosis, preventing lipid peroxidation and inflammation
    in the mouse models of diet-induced NAFLD. Under these conditions, increased Deptor
    levels and the concomitant repression of mTOR signaling were associated with augmented
    fatty acid oxidation and reduced lipid content. Moreover, Deptor silencing in
    isolated mouse hepatocytes abolished the anti-steatotic effects mediated by neddylation
    inhibition. Finally, serum NEDD8 levels correlated with hepatic neddylation during
    the disease progression in the clinical and pre-clinical models CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
    the upregulation of Deptor, driven by neddylation inhibition, is proposed as a
    novel effective target and therapeutic approach to tackle NAFLD.'
  - 'passage: Estimates of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) have declined
    in recent months (1,2) because of waning vaccine induced immunity over time,*
    possible increased immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 variants (3), or a combination
    of these and other factors. CDC recommends that all persons aged ≥12 years receive
    a third dose (booster) of an mRNA vaccine ≥5 months after receipt of the second
    mRNA vaccine dose and that immunocompromised individuals receive a third primary
    dose.† A third dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine increases neutralizing
    antibody levels (4), and three recent studies from Israel have shown improved
    effectiveness of a third dose in preventing COVID-19 associated with infections
    with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant (5-7). Yet, data are limited on
    the real-world effectiveness of third doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the United
    States, especially since the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant became predominant
    in mid-December 2021. The VISION Network§ examined VE by analyzing 222,772 encounters
    from 383 emergency departments (EDs) and urgent care (UC) clinics and 87,904 hospitalizations
    from 259 hospitals among adults aged ≥18 years across 10 states from August 26,
    2021¶ to January 5, 2022. Analyses were stratified by the period before and after
    the Omicron variant became the predominant strain (>50% of sequenced viruses)
    at each study site. During the period of Delta predominance across study sites
    in the United States (August-mid-December 2021), VE against laboratory-confirmed
    COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was 86% 14-179 days after dose 2, 76%
    ≥180 days after dose 2, and 94% ≥14 days after dose 3. Estimates of VE for the
    same intervals after vaccination during Omicron variant predominance were 52%,
    38%, and 82%, respectively. During the period of Delta variant predominance, VE
    against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 90% 14-179
    days after dose 2, 81% ≥180 days after dose 2, and 94% ≥14 days after dose 3.
    During Omicron variant predominance, VE estimates for the same intervals after
    vaccination were 81%, 57%, and 90%, respectively. The highest estimates of VE
    against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters or hospitalizations during both
    Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods were among adults who received a third
    dose of mRNA vaccine. All unvaccinated persons should get vaccinated as soon as
    possible. All adults who have received mRNA vaccines during their primary COVID-19
    vaccination series should receive a third dose when eligible, and eligible persons
    should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.'

  - 'passage: BACKGROUND: Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against
    the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different
    populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines
    against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2)
    variant first identified in South Africa. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter,
    double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of
    the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency
    virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were
    assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×10(10) viral
    particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum
    samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus
    and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the
    B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine
    against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more
    than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020,
    we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants
    received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus
    and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351
    variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from
    placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19
    developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients
    (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], −49.9 to 59.8).
    Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351
    variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point,
    was 10.4% (95% CI, −76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was
    balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen
    of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate
    Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

  - 'passage: Genebanks collect and preserve vast collections of plants and detailed
    passport information, with the aim of preserving genetic diversity for conservation
    and breeding. Genetic characterization of such collections has the potential to
    elucidate the genetic histories of important crops, use marker-trait associations
    to identify loci controlling traits of interest, search for loci undergoing selection,
    and contribute to genebank management by identifying taxonomic misassignments
    and duplicates. We conducted a genomic scan with genotyping by sequencing (GBS)
    derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 10,038 pepper (Capsicum spp.)
    accessions from worldwide genebanks and investigated the recent history of this
    iconic staple. Genomic data detected up to 1,618 duplicate accessions within and
    between genebanks and showed that taxonomic ambiguity and misclassification often
    involve interspecific hybrids that are difficult to classify morphologically.
    We deeply interrogated the genetic diversity of the commonly consumed Capsicum
    annuum to investigate its history, finding that the kinds of peppers collected
    in broad regions across the globe overlap considerably. The method ReMIXTURE-using
    genetic data to quantify the similarity between the complement of peppers from
    a focal region and those from other regions-was developed to supplement traditional
    population genetic analyses. The results reflect a vision of pepper as a highly
    desirable and tradable cultural commodity, spreading rapidly throughout the globe
    along major maritime and terrestrial trade routes. Marker associations and possible
    selective sweeps affecting traits such as pungency were observed, and these traits
    were shown to be distributed nonuniformly across the globe, suggesting that human
    preferences exerted a primary influence over domesticated pepper genetic structure.'
  - 'passage: During the development of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
    2 (SARS-CoV2), a myriad of complications has emerged and although rare, several
    genitourinary complications have been reported. The bulk of these complications
    have been secondary to hypercoagulable states, such as priapism. Previous SARS
    family infections have caused orchitis, though no adult cases of orchitis have
    been reported. We describe a novel case of SARS-CoV2 bilateral orchitis in a previously
    healthy 37-year-old male who presented for testicular pain with constitutional
    symptoms. Additionally, there was no epididymitis associated with the bilateral
    orchitis. Based on both data in SARS-CoV2 infected males and previous data from
    prior SARS infections, spermatocyte function may be compromised secondary to this
    infection. With the various symptoms associated with this virulent pathogen, we
    characterize the potential complications and importance of fertility follow up.'

  - 'passage: INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in 2020 and has
    affected millions of lives. Surgical training has also been significantly affected
    by this pandemic, but the exact effect remains unknown. We sought to perform a
    national survey of general surgery residents in the United States to assess the
    effect of COVID-19 on surgical resident training, education, and burnout. METHODS:
    An anonymous online survey was created and distributed to general surgery residents
    across the United States. The survey aimed to assess changes to surgical residents’
    clinical schedules, operative volume, and educational curricula as a result of
    the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we sought to assess the impact of COVID-19
    on resident burnout. RESULTS: 1102 general surgery residents completed the survey.
    Residents reported a significant decline in the number of cases performed during
    the pandemic. Educational curricula were largely shifted towards online didactics.
    The majority of residents reported spending more time on educational didactics
    than before the pandemic. The majority of residents feared contracting COVID-19
    or transmitting it to their family during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19
    has had significant impact on surgical training and education. One positive consequence
    of the pandemic is increased educational didactics. Online didactics should continue
    to be a part of surgical education in the post-COVID-19 era. Steps need to be
    taken to ensure that graduating surgical residents are adequately prepared for
    fellowship and independent practice despite the significantly decreased case volumes
    during this pandemic. Surgery training programs should focus on providing non-technical
    clinical training and professional development during this time.'
  - 'passage: The molecular properties of CD8(+) T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2
    infection are not fully known. Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes
    of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8(+) T cells, obtained using a modified Antigen-Reactive
    T cell Enrichment (ARTE) assay, from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects.
    COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based on whether the dominant CD8(+)
    T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was ‘exhausted’ or not. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells
    in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity
    and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness.
    In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the dominant non-exhausted subset from
    patients with severe disease showed enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation,
    pro-survival NF-κB signaling, and anti-apoptotic pathways, suggesting the generation
    of robust CD8(+) T cell memory responses in patients with severe COVID-19 illness.
    CD8(+) T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy
    subjects displayed polyfunctional features and enhanced glycolysis. Cells with
    such features were largely absent in SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from both COVID-19
    patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our single-cell
    analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8(+) T cells responding
    to SARS-CoV-2.'
  - 'passage: BACKGROUND: Waning of protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 conferred
    by 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine begins shortly after inoculation and becomes
    substantial within four months. With that, the impact of prior infection on incident
    SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is unclear. Therefore, we examined the long-term protection
    of naturally acquired immunity (protection conferred by previous infection) compared
    to vaccine-induced immunity. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of 124,500
    persons, compared two groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals who received a
    two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, and (2) previously
    infected individuals who have not been vaccinated. Two multivariate logistic regression
    models were applied, evaluating four SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes - infection,
    symptomatic disease (COVID-19), hospitalization and death – between June 1 to
    August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-naïve
    vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08-21.11) increased risk for breakthrough
    infection with the Delta variant compared to unvaccinated-previously-infected
    individuals, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January
    and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant for symptomatic disease
    as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time between March 2020 to
    February 2021, evidence of waning naturally acquired immunity was demonstrated,
    though SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinees still had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85-7.33) increased
    risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51-9.21) increased

  - 'passage: SARS-CoV-2, commonly termed COVID-19 for the illness it causes, has
    infected >3.2 million people, including >220,000 deaths. Human milk IgG originates
    mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk
    would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk
    Abs originating from mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (1). Therefore, the extent
    of the milk immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (2). This response is critical
    for infants and young children, who tend not to suffer greatly from COVID-19 pathology
    but are likely responsible for significant virus transmission (3-5). Perhaps even
    more significant is the fact that milk Abs could be purified and used as a COVID-19
    therapeutic, given they would likely be of the secretory (s) class and highly
    resistant to proteolytic degradation in the respiratory tissue (2, 6). In this
    preliminary report, 15 milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with
    SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 negative control samples obtained prior to December 2019
    were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2
    Spike protein by ELISAs measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory Ab. Eighty percent
    of samples obtained post-COVID-19 exhibited IgA reactivity, and all these samples
    were also positive for secretory Ab reactivity, suggesting the IgA is predominantly
    sIgA. COVID-19 group mean OD values of undiluted milk were significantly greater
    for IgA (p<0.0001), secretory-type Abs (p<0.0001), and IgG (p=0.017), but not
    for IgM, compared to pre-pandemic group mean values. Overall, these data indicate
    that there is strong sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk after
    infection in the majority of individuals, and that a comprehensive study of this
    response is highly warranted.'

    (COVID-19) is critical. We conducted a descriptive analysis using public health
    data to describe age- and sex-specific acute care use, length of stay (LOS) and
    mortality associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis
    using Ontario’s Case and Contact Management Plus database of individuals who tested
    positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Ontario
    from Mar. 1 to Sept. 30, 2020, to determine age- and sex-specific hospital admissions,
    intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, use of invasive mechanical ventilation,
    LOS and mortality. We stratified analyses by month of infection to study temporal
    trends and conducted subgroup analyses by long-term care residency. RESULTS: During
    the observation period, 56 476 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were
    reported; 41 049 (72.7%) of these were younger than 60 years, and 29 196 (51.7%)
    were female. Proportion of cases shifted from older populations (> 60 yr) to younger
    populations (10–39 yr) over time. Overall, 5383 (9.5%) of individuals were admitted
    to hospital; of these, 1183 (22.0%) were admitted to the ICU, and 712 (60.2%)
    of these received invasive mechanical ventilation. Mean LOS for individuals in
    the ward, ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical
    ventilation was 12.8 (standard deviation [SD] 15.4), 8.5 (SD 7.8) and 20.5 (SD
    18.1) days, respectively. Among patients receiving care in the ward, ICU without
    invasive mechanical ventilation and ICU with invasive mechanical ventilation,
    911/3834 (23.8%), 124/418 (29.7%) and 287/635 (45.2%) died, respectively. All
    outcomes varied by age and decreased over time, overall and within age groups.
    INTERPRETATION: This descriptive study shows use of acute care and mortality varying
    by age and decreasing between March and September 2020 in Ontario. Improvements
    in clinical practice and changing risk distributions among those infected may
    contribute to fewer severe outcomes.'
  - 'passage: This article summarizes the likely benefits of melatonin in the attenuation
    of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19
    has become a pandemic with tens of thousands of infected patients. Based on clinical
    features, pathology, the pathogenesis of acute respiratory disorder induced by
    either highly homogenous coronaviruses or other pathogens, the evidence suggests
    that excessive inflammation, oxidation, and an exaggerated immune response very
    likely contribute to COVID-19 pathology. This leads to a cytokine storm and subsequent
    progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
    and often death. Melatonin, a well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative
    molecule, is protective against ALI/ARDS caused by viral and other pathogens.
    Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability,
    anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial
    for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high
    safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related
    diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Additional
    experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.'

  - 'passage: Vestibular dysfunction, causing dizziness and imbalance, is a common
    yet poorly understood feature in patients with TBI. Damage to the inner ear, nerve,
    brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres may all affect vestibular functioning,
    hence, a multi-level assessment-from reflex to perception-is required. In a previous
    report, postural instability was the commonest neurological feature in ambulating
    acute patients with TBI. During ward assessment, we also frequently observe a
    loss of vertigo sensation in patients with acute TBI, common inner ear conditions
    and a related vigorous vestibular-ocular reflex nystagmus, suggesting a ''vestibular
    agnosia''. Patients with vestibular agnosia were also more unbalanced; however,
    the link between vestibular agnosia and imbalance was confounded by the presence
    of inner ear conditions. We investigated the brain mechanisms of imbalance in
    acute TBI, its link with vestibular agnosia, and potential clinical impact, by
    prospective laboratory assessment of vestibular function, from reflex to perception,
    in patients with preserved peripheral vestibular function. Assessment included:
    vestibular reflex function, vestibular perception by participants'' report of
    their passive yaw rotations in the dark, objective balance via posturography,
    subjective symptoms via questionnaires, and structural neuroimaging. We prospectively
    screened 918 acute admissions, assessed 146 and recruited 37. Compared to 37 matched
    controls, patients showed elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds (patients
    12.92°/s versus 3.87°/s) but normal vestibular-ocular reflex thresholds (patients
    2.52°/s versus 1.78°/s). Patients with elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds
    [3 standard deviations (SD) above controls'' average], were designated as having
    vestibular agnosia, and displayed worse posturography than non-vestibular-agnosia
    patients, despite no difference in vestibular symptom scores. Only in patients
    with impaired postural control (3 SD above controls'' mean), whole brain diffusion
    tensor voxel-wise analysis showed elevated mean diffusivity (and trend lower fractional
    anisotropy) in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe
    that correlated with vestibular agnosia severity. Thus, impaired balance and vestibular
    agnosia are co-localized to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right
    temporal lobe. Finally, a clinical audit showed a sevenfold reduction in clinician
    recognition of a common peripheral vestibular condition (benign paroxysmal positional
    vertigo) in acute patients with clinically apparent vestibular agnosia. That vestibular
    agnosia patients show worse balance, but without increased dizziness symptoms,
    explains why clinicians may miss treatable vestibular diagnoses in these patients.
    In conclusion, vestibular agnosia mediates imbalance in traumatic brain injury
    both directly via white matter tract damage in the right temporal lobe, and indirectly
    via reduced clinical recognition of common, treatable vestibular diagnoses.'
  - 'passage: BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human
    health around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR
    on incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific
    pathogen–drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study presents
    the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date. METHODS: We estimated
    deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated
    with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen–drug combinations in 204 countries
    and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic literature reviews,
    hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million
    individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. We used predictive
    statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including
    for locations with no data. Our approach can be divided into five broad components:
    number of deaths where infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths
    attributable to a given infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome
    deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant
    to an antibiotic of interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection
    associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease
    burden based on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative
    scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible
    infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario
    in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated
    95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered
    values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample
    predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the global and regional
    level. FINDINGS: On the basis of our predictive statistical models, there were
    an estimated 4·95 million (3·62–6·57) deaths associated with bacterial AMR in
    2019, including 1·27 million (95% UI 0·911–1·71) deaths attributable to bacterial
    AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age death rate attributable to
    resistance to be highest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 27·3 deaths per 100
    000 (20·9–35·3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6·5 deaths (4·3–9·4) per 100 000.
    Lower respiratory infections accounted for more than 1·5 million deaths associated
    with resistance in 2019, making it the most burdensome infectious syndrome. The
    six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance (Escherichia coli,
    followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
    Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were responsible for 929
    000 (660 000–1 270 000) deaths attributable to AMR and 3·57 million (2·62–4·78)
    deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One pathogen–drug combination, meticillin-resistant
    S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six
    more each caused 50 000–100 000 deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively

    carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant
    K pneumoniae, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae. INTERPRETATION:
    To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the
    global burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR
    is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource
    settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen–drug combinations
    contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location-specific policy
    decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access
    to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics.
    There are serious data gaps in many low-income settings, emphasising the need
    to expand microbiology laboratory capacity and data collection systems to improve
    our understanding of this important human health threat. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda

  - 'passage: IMPORTANCE: Black and Hispanic populations have higher rates of coronavirus
    disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality than White populations but
    lower in-hospital case-fatality rates. The extent to which neighborhood characteristics
    and comorbidity explain these disparities is unclear. Outcomes in Asian American
    populations have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To compare COVID-19 outcomes based
    on race and ethnicity and assess the association of any disparities with comorbidity
    and neighborhood characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective
    cohort study was conducted within the New York University Langone Health system,
    which includes over 260 outpatient practices and 4 acute care hospitals. All patients
    within the system’s integrated health record who were tested for severe acute
    respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were
    identified and followed up through May 13, 2020. Data were analyzed in June 2020.
    Among 11 547 patients tested, outcomes were compared by race and ethnicity and
    examined against differences by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, insurance
    type, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. EXPOSURES: Race and ethnicity categorized
    using self-reported electronic health record data (ie, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
    Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial/other patients). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
    The likelihood of receiving a positive test, hospitalization, and critical illness
    (defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical
    ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). RESULTS: Among 9722 patients (mean
    [SD] age, 50.7 [17.5] years; 58.8% women), 4843 (49.8%) were positive for COVID-19;
    2623 (54.2%) of those were admitted for hospitalization (1047 [39.9%] White, 375
    [14.3%] Black, 715 [27.3%] Hispanic, 180 [6.9%] Asian, 207 [7.9%] multiracial/other).
    In fully adjusted models, Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6)
    and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) were more likely than White patients
    to test positive. Among those who tested positive, odds of hospitalization were
    similar among White, Hispanic, and Black patients, but higher among Asian (OR,
    1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and multiracial patients (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) compared
    with White patients. Among those hospitalized, Black patients were less likely
    than White patients to have severe illness (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8) and to die
    or be discharged to hospice (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9). CONCLUSIONS
    AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients in a large health system in New
    York City, Black and Hispanic patients were more likely, and Asian patients less
    likely, than White patients to test positive; once hospitalized, Black patients
    were less likely than White patients to have critical illness or die after adjustment
    for comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. This supports the assertion
    that existing structural determinants pervasive in Black and Hispanic communities
    may explain the disproportionately higher out-of-hospital deaths due to COVID-19
    infections in these populations.'

    "passage: Vestibular dysfunction, causing dizziness and imbalance, is a common yet poorly understood feature in patients with TBI. Damage to the inner ear, nerve, brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres may all affect vestibular functioning, hence, a multi-level assessment-from reflex to perception-is required. In a previous report, postural instability was the commonest neurological feature in ambulating acute patients with TBI. During ward assessment, we also frequently observe a loss of vertigo sensation in patients with acute TBI, common inner ear conditions and a related vigorous vestibular-ocular reflex nystagmus, suggesting a 'vestibular agnosia'. Patients with vestibular agnosia were also more unbalanced; however, the link between vestibular agnosia and imbalance was confounded by the presence of inner ear conditions. We investigated the brain mechanisms of imbalance in acute TBI, its link with vestibular agnosia, and potential clinical impact, by prospective laboratory assessment of vestibular function, from reflex to perception, in patients with preserved peripheral vestibular function. Assessment included: vestibular reflex function, vestibular perception by participants' report of their passive yaw rotations in the dark, objective balance via posturography, subjective symptoms via questionnaires, and structural neuroimaging. We prospectively screened 918 acute admissions, assessed 146 and recruited 37. Compared to 37 matched controls, patients showed elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds (patients 12.92°/s versus 3.87°/s) but normal vestibular-ocular reflex thresholds (patients 2.52°/s versus 1.78°/s). Patients with elevated vestibular-perceptual thresholds [3 standard deviations (SD) above controls' average], were designated as having vestibular agnosia, and displayed worse posturography than non-vestibular-agnosia patients, despite no difference in vestibular symptom scores. Only in patients with impaired postural control (3 SD above controls' mean), whole brain diffusion tensor voxel-wise analysis showed elevated mean diffusivity (and trend lower fractional anisotropy) in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe that correlated with vestibular agnosia severity. Thus, impaired balance and vestibular agnosia are co-localized to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the right temporal lobe. Finally, a clinical audit showed a sevenfold reduction in clinician recognition of a common peripheral vestibular condition (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) in acute patients with clinically apparent vestibular agnosia. That vestibular agnosia patients show worse balance, but without increased dizziness symptoms, explains why clinicians may miss treatable vestibular diagnoses in these patients. In conclusion, vestibular agnosia mediates imbalance in traumatic brain injury both directly via white matter tract damage in the right temporal lobe, and indirectly via reduced clinical recognition of common, treatable vestibular diagnoses.",

However, there is evidence that such curfews have little or no effect on disease dynamics when other measures such as bans on gatherings or business and school closures are already in place. There are two possible explanations for this. First, nighttime curfews may elicit reactance—a feeling of anger that drives non-adherence; second, nighttime curfews may motivate people to shift activities from night to daytime, thereby increasing contact density. METHODS: A survey experiment was conducted with German participants (N = 997) to investigate public perceptions of nighttime curfews and possible detrimental effects on contact behaviors. RESULTS: Most participants perceived nighttime curfews as ineffective. The introduction of a hypothetical curfew did not affect intentions to reduce private contacts but instead elicited reactance, motivating partici...</code> | <code>passage: OBJECTIVES: The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here, we compare the outcomes of a cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. METHODS: In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by age, sex and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, intensive care unit admission or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and the potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID-19 treatment, using logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 (IQR 53–78) years and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases we...</code> |
