  - 'passage: OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease
    2019 (COVID‐19) in rheumatic patients treated with targeted synthetic or biological
    anti‐rheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs) compared with the general population living
    in the same Italian region. METHODS: Patients followed at two referral rheumatology
    centres in Lombardy from 25(th) February to 10(th) April 2020 were invited to
    participate in a survey to detect patients with confirmed COVID‐19, close contacts
    with known COVID‐19 cases, symptoms of infection, working, behavioural and disease
    management changes applied to prevent the contagion. The incidence of COVID‐19
    in the Lombardy population was obtained from the National Institute of Statistics.
    Confirmed COVID‐19 was defined by nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The survey was
    circulated amongst 955 patients (531 rheumatoid arthritis, 203 psoriatic arthritis,
    181 spondyloarthritis, and 40 of connective tissue diseases/vasculitides/autoinflammatory
    diseases; mean age 53.7 years; female: 67.4%). The rate of responders was 98.05%.
    The incidence of confirmed COVID‐19 is consistent with the general population
    (0.62% vs 0.66%; p=0.92). None of the patients had severe complications or required
    intensive care treatment, and all of them temporarily discontinued ongoing ts/bDMARDs
    therapy. Almost all patients adopted precautions to prevent the contagion (90.6%)
    and maintained the ongoing treatment with ts/bDMARDs (93.2%). The disease activity
    remained stable in 89.5% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the attitude
    from rheumatic patients to prevent the contagion while maintaining their chronic
    treatments. The incidence and severity of COVID‐19 in patients treated with ts/bDMARDs
    was not significantly different from that of the general population in the same
    region.'
  - 'passage: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth
    masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The null hypothesis
    is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks. SETTING:
    14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 1607
    hospital HCWs aged ≥18 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. INTERVENTION:
    Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group
    (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every
    shift for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness
    (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus
    infection. RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth
    mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth
    mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical
    mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with
    the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65)
    and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly
    higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration
    of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%. CONCLUSIONS:
    This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the
    use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health
    and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result
    in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread
    use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks
    should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and
    guidelines need to be updated. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand

  - 'passage: The immune system of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is severely impaired.
    Detailed investigation of T cells and cytokine production in patients affected
    by COVID-19 pneumonia are urgently required. Here we show that, compared with
    healthy controls, COVID-19 patients’ T cell compartment displays several alterations
    involving naïve, central memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated
    cells, as well as regulatory T cells and PD1(+)CD57(+) exhausted T cells. Significant
    alterations exist also in several lineage-specifying transcription factors and
    chemokine receptors. Terminally differentiated T cells from patients proliferate
    less than those from healthy controls, whereas their mitochondria functionality
    is similar in CD4(+) T cells from both groups. Patients display significant increases
    of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines, including T helper type-1 and
    type-2 cytokines, chemokines and galectins; their lymphocytes produce more tumor
    necrosis factor (TNF), interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-17, with the last
    observation implying that blocking IL-17 could provide a novel therapeutic strategy
    for COVID-19.'
- source_sentence: 'query: "Our research indicates possible human consequences beyond
    COVID-19''s direct health impacts may be relatively under-recognized, downplayed,
    or given less moral significance."'
  sentences:
  - 'passage: We hypothesized that because Covid-19 (C19) remains an urgent and visible
    threat, efforts to combat its negative health consequences have become moralized.
    This moralization of health-based efforts may generate asymmetries in judgement,
    whereby harmful by-products of those efforts (i.e., instrumental harm) are perceived
    as more acceptable than harm resulting from non-C19 efforts, such as prioritizing
    the economy or non-C19 issues. We tested our predictions in two experimental studies.
    In Study 1, American participants evaluated the same costs (public shaming, deaths
    and illnesses, and police abuse of power) as more acceptable when they resulted
    from efforts to minimize C19''s health impacts, than when they resulted from non-health
    C19 efforts (e.g., prioritizing economic costs) or efforts unrelated to C19 (e.g.,
    reducing traffic deaths). In Study 2, New Zealand participants less favorably
    evaluated the quality of a research proposal empirically questioning continuing
    a C19 elimination strategy in NZ than one questioning abandoning an elimination
    strategy, although both proposals contained the same amount of methodology information.
    This finding suggests questioning elimination approaches is morally condemned,
    a similar response to that found when sacred values are questioned. In both studies,
    condition effects were mediated by lowered moral outrage in response to costs
    resulting from pursuing health-minded C19 efforts. Follow-up analyses revealed
    that both heightened personal concern over contracting C19 and liberal ideology
    were associated with greater asymmetries in human cost evaluation. Altogether,
    results suggest reducing or eliminating C19 have become moralized, generating
    asymmetries in evaluations of human suffering.'
  - 'passage: IMPORTANCE: Time spent in outdoor activities has decreased owing to
    home confinement for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Concerns
    have been raised about whether home confinement may have worsened the burden of
    myopia owing to substantially decreased time spent outdoors and increased screen
    time at home. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the refractive changes and prevalence
    of myopia in school-aged children during the COVID-19 home confinement. DESIGN,
    SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cross-sectional study using school-based
    photoscreenings in 123 535 children aged 6 to 13 years from 10 elementary schools
    in Feicheng, China, was conducted. The study was performed during 6 consecutive
    years (2015-2020). Data were analyzed in July 2020. EXPOSURES: Noncycloplegic
    photorefraction was examined using a photoscreener device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
    The spherical equivalent refraction was recorded for each child and the prevalence
    of myopia for each age group during each year was calculated. The mean spherical
    equivalent refraction and prevalence of myopia were compared between 2020 (after
    home confinement) and the previous 5 years for each age group. RESULTS: Of the
    123 535 children included in the study, 64 335 (52.1%) were boys. A total of 194
    904 test results (389 808 eyes) were included in the analysis. A substantial myopic
    shift (approximately −0.3 diopters [D]) was found in the 2020 school-based photoscreenings
    compared with previous years (2015-2019) for younger children aged 6 (−0.32 D),
    7 (−0.28 D), and 8 (−0.29 D) years. The prevalence of myopia in the 2020 photoscreenings
    was higher than the highest prevalence of myopia within 2015-2019 for children
    aged 6 (21.5% vs 5.7%), 7 (26.2% vs 16.2%), and 8 (37.2% vs 27.7%) years. The
    differences in spherical equivalent refraction and the prevalence of myopia between
    2020 and previous years were minimal in children aged 9 to 13 years. CONCLUSIONS
    AND RELEVANCE: Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be associated
    with a significant myopic shift for children aged 6 to 8 years according to 2020
    school-based photoscreenings. However, numerous limitations warrant caution in
    the interpretation of these associations, including use of noncycloplegic refractions
    and lack of orthokeratology history or ocular biometry data. Younger children’s
    refractive status may be more sensitive to environmental changes than older ages,
    given the younger children are in a critical period for the development of myopia.'
  - 'passage: During critical care, at least until the late stage of the disease,
    severely ill COVID‐19 patients may have relatively well preserved lung compliance
    but remain severely hypoxaemic. A recent theoretical study suggested a direct
    interaction between COVID‐19 viral proteins and haemoglobin (Hb) that could lead
    to a loss of oxygen carrying capacity. As national guidelines strongly support
    a restrictive transfusion strategy in the critically ill, any right‐shift in the
    Hb O(2) affinity curve could contribute to the hypoxaemia and be potentially harmful.
    We have measured Hb O(2) affinity curves from severely ill COVID‐19 patients and,
    in comparison to age‐ and sex‐matched controls, find no evidence for a shift in
    O(2) affinity that would support any change in clinical management.'

  sentences:
  - 'passage: Mutagenic ribonucleosides can act as broad-based antiviral agents. They
    are metabolized to the active ribonucleoside triphosphate form and concentrate
    in the genomes of RNA viruses during viral replication. β-D-N (4)-hydroxycytidine
    (NHC, the initial metabolite of molnupiravir) is more than 100-fold more active
    than ribavirin or favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2, with antiviral activity correlated
    to the level of mutagenesis in virion RNA. However, NHC also displays host mutational
    activity in an animal cell culture assay, consistent with RNA and DNA precursors
    sharing a common intermediate of a ribonucleoside diphosphate. These results indicate
    that highly active mutagenic ribonucleosides may hold risk for the host.'
  - 'passage: BACKGROUND: The femoral nerve block (FNB) may be used for analgesia
    in hip fracture surgery. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a novel
    regional technique and may provide better pain reduction while preserving motor
    function, but these blocks have not been directly compared. METHODS: In a single-center
    double-blinded randomized comparative trial, patients presenting for hip fracture
    surgery received analgesia with either FNB or PENG block. The primary outcome
    measure was pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10). Secondary outcomes
    were postoperative quadriceps strength, opiate use, complications, length of hospital
    stay, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized and
    equally allocated between groups. Baseline demographics were similar. Postoperatively
    in recovery (day 0), the PENG group experienced less pain compared with the FNB
    group. (In the PENG group, 63% experienced no pain, 27% mild pain, and 10% moderate
    to severe pain. In comparison, 30% of the FNB group reported no pain, 27% mild
    pain, and 36% moderate to severe pain; p=0.04). This was assessed using an 11-point
    Likert NRS. Quadriceps strength was better preserved in the PENG group in the
    recovery unit (assessed using Oxford muscle strength grading, 60% intact in the
    PENG group vs none intact in the FNB group; p<0.001) and on day 1 (90% intact
    vs 50%, respectively; p=0.004). There was no difference in other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:
    Patients receiving a PENG block for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia
    during hip fracture surgery experience less postoperative pain in the recovery
    room with no difference detected by postoperative day 1. Quadriceps strength was
    better preserved with the PENG block. Despite the short-term analgesic benefit
    and improved quadriceps strength, there were no differences detected in the quality
    of recovery.'
  - 'passage: Importance As a result of low numbers of pediatric cases early in the
    COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains an understudied
    topic. Objective To determine whether there are differences in the odds of household
    transmission by younger children compared with older children. Design, Setting,
    and Participants This population-based cohort study took place between June 1
    and December 31, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Private households in which the index
    case individual of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was younger than
    18 years were included. Individuals were excluded if they resided in apartments
    missing suite information, in households with multiple index cases, or in households
    where the age of the index case individual was missing. Exposures Age group of
    pediatric index cases categorized as 0 to 3, 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 17 years.
    Main Outcomes and Measures Household transmission, defined as households where
    at least 1 secondary case occurred 1 to 14 days after the pediatric index case.
    Results A total of 6280 households had pediatric index cases, and 1717 households
    (27.3%) experienced secondary transmission. The mean (SD) age of pediatric index
    case individuals was 10.7 (5.1) years and 2863 (45.6%) were female individuals.
    Children aged 0 to 3 years had the highest odds of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to
    household contacts compared with children aged 14 to 17 years (odds ratio, 1.43;
    95% CI, 1.17-1.75). This association was similarly observed in sensitivity analyses
    defining secondary cases as 2 to 14 days or 4 to 14 days after the index case
    and stratified analyses by presence of symptoms, association with a school/childcare
    outbreak, or school/childcare reopening. Children aged 4 to 8 years and 9 to 13
    years also had increased odds of transmission (aged 4-8 years: odds ratio, 1.40;
    95% CI, 1.18-1.67; aged 9-13 years: odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.32). Conclusions
    and Relevance This study suggests that younger children may be more likely to
    transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with older children, and the highest odds
    of transmission was observed for children aged 0 to 3 years. Differential infectivity
    of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention within households,
    as well as schools/childcare, to minimize risk of household secondary transmission.
    Additional population-based studies are required to establish the risk of transmission
    by younger pediatric index cases.'

  - 'passage: Genital psoriasis affects 2-5% of psoriasis patients; generalised plaque
    or intertriginous psoriasis also affects the genital area in 29-40% of cases.
    Anogenital psoriasis has been associated with significant quality of life impairments,
    but little is known about specific patient needs/treatment goals. This study aimed
    to examine the overall and sex-related disease burden, patient needs and treatment
    benefits in patients with anogenital psoriasis, compared to patients with psoriasis
    not affecting the anal/genital areas. Within the cross-sectional nationwide survey,
    2,009 participants were consecutively recruited in 157 randomly assigned German
    dermatology practices and clinics, according to the following inclusion criteria
    aged 18 years or over; diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris; ability to answer the
    questionnaires; and written informed consent. Based on a high-resolution grid
    on the topical distribution of psoriasis, two groups were formed: anogenital psoriasis
    (n = 622) and comparison group (n = 1,303). Clinical severity was assessed by
    the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients completed the EuroQoL visual
    analogue scale (EQ VAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Patient
    Benefit Index (PBI). Patients with anogenital psoriasis had higher PASI (13.0±10.6
    vs. 8.9±7.6, P < 0.001) and more DLQI impairments (8.9±6.9 vs. 7.0±6.2, P = 0.002)
    than controls. At the item-level, they also reported more sex-related DLQI impairments
    (DLQI-i9: 0.5±0.8 vs. 0.3±0.7, P < 0.001) and treatment needs (PBI-i17: 2.2±1.8
    vs. 1.9±1.8, P = 0.001). A great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses
    was found for sex-related items (23.3-41.9%). These results suggest that the assessment
    of sex-related impairments and treatment needs should be prioritised in patients
    with anogenital psoriasis. Questionnaires may be used as a less uncomfortable
    way for patients to discuss their genital lesions and sexual function during healthcare
    visits. However, the great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses to sex-related
    items calls for in-depth assessments and effective patient-physician communication
    regarding these sensitive topics.'
  - 'passage: Diterpenes and their derivatives have many biological activities, including
    anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. To date, several diterpenes, diterpenoids,

    activities. This study summarizes the literature about diterpenes and their derivatives
    acting against rheumatoid arthritis (RA) depending on the database reports until
    31 August 2021. For this, we have conducted an extensive search in databases such
    as PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov using specific
    relevant keywords. The search yielded 2708 published records, among which 48 have
    been included in this study. The findings offer several potential diterpenes and
    their derivatives as anti-RA in various test models. Among the diterpenes and
    their derivatives, andrographolide, triptolide, and tanshinone IIA have been found
    to exhibit anti-RA activity through diverse pathways. In addition, some important
    derivatives of triptolide and tanshinone IIA have also been shown to have anti-RA
    effects. Overall, findings suggest that these substances could reduce arthritis
    score, downregulate oxidative, proinflammatory, and inflammatory biomarkers, modulate
    various arthritis pathways, and improve joint destruction and clinical arthritic
    conditions, signs, symptoms, and physical functions in humans and numerous experimental
    animals, mainly through cytokine and chemokine as well as several physiological
    protein interaction pathways. Taken all together, diterpenes, diterpenoids, and

    persons aged <18 years who had COVID-19 highlights the importance of COVID-19
    prevention strategies, including vaccination, for all eligible persons in this
    age group,§ in addition to chronic disease prevention and management. The mechanism

  - 'passage: OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of hospital admission with covid-19
    and severe covid-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared
    with healthcare workers and adults of working age in the general population. DESIGN:
    Population based nested case-control study. SETTING: Scotland, March 2020 to July
    2021, during defined periods of school closures and full openings in response
    to covid-19. PARTICIPANTS: All cases of covid-19 in adults aged 21 to 65 (n=132
    420) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex, and general practice
    (n=1 306 566). Adults were identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school
    by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and their household members were
    identified through the unique property reference number. The comparator groups
    were adults identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members,
    and the remaining general population of working age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
    primary outcome was hospital admission with covid-19, defined as having a positive
    test result for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital admission, being admitted to hospital
    within 28 days of a positive test result, or receiving a diagnosis of covid-19
    on discharge from hospital. Severe covid-19 was defined as being admitted to intensive
    care or dying within 28 days of a positive test result or assigned covid-19 as
    a cause of death. RESULTS: Most teachers were young (mean age 42), were women
    (80%), and had no comorbidities (84%). The risk (cumulative incidence) of hospital
    admission with covid-19 was <1% for all adults of working age in the general population.
    Over the study period, in conditional logistic regression models adjusted for
    age, sex, general practice, race/ethnicity, deprivation, number of comorbidities,
    and number of adults in the household, teachers showed a lower risk of hospital
    admission with covid-19 (rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.92)
    and of severe covid-19 (0.56, 0.33 to 0.97) than the general population. In the
    first period when schools in Scotland reopened, in autumn 2020, the rate ratio
    for hospital admission in teachers was 1.20 (0.89 to 1.61) and for severe covid-19
    was 0.45 (0.13 to 1.55). The corresponding findings for household members of teachers
    were 0.91 (0.67 to 1.23) and 0.73 (0.37 to 1.44), and for patient facing healthcare
    workers were 2.08 (1.73 to 2.50) and 2.26 (1.43 to 3.59). Similar risks were seen

    'passage: OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of hospital admission with covid-19 and severe covid-19 among teachers and their household members, overall and compared with healthcare workers and adults of working age in the general population. DESIGN: Population based nested case-control study. SETTING: Scotland, March 2020 to July 2021, during defined periods of school closures and full openings in response to covid-19. PARTICIPANTS: All cases of covid-19 in adults aged 21 to 65 (n=132 420) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex, and general practice (n=1 306 566). Adults were identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and their household members were identified through the unique property reference number. The comparator groups were adults identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining general population of working age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was hospital admission with covid-19, defined as having a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital admission, being admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test result, or receiving a diagnosis of covid-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe covid-19 was defined as being admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test result or assigned covid-19 as a cause of death. RESULTS: Most teachers were young (mean age 42), were women (80%), and had no comorbidities (84%). The risk (cumulative incidence) of hospital admission with covid-19 was <1% for all adults of working age in the general population. Over the study period, in conditional logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, general practice, race/ethnicity, deprivation, number of comorbidities, and number of adults in the household, teachers showed a lower risk of hospital admission with covid-19 (rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.92) and of severe covid-19 (0.56, 0.33 to 0.97) than the general population. In the first period when schools in Scotland reopened, in autumn 2020, the rate ratio for hospital admission in teachers was 1.20 (0.89 to 1.61) and for severe covid-19 was 0.45 (0.13 to 1.55). The corresponding findings for household members of teachers were 0.91 (0.67 to 1.23) and 0.73 (0.37 to 1.44), and for patient facing healthcare workers were 2.08 (1.73 to 2.50) and 2.26 (1.43 to 3.59). Similar risks were seen for teachers in the second period, when schools reopened in summer 2021. These values were higher than those seen in spring/summer 2020, when schools were mostly closed. CONCLUSION: Compared with adults of working age who are otherwise similar, teachers and their household members were not found to be at increased risk of hospital admission with covid-19 and were found to be at lower risk of severe covid-19. These findings should reassure those who are engaged in face-to-face teaching.',
    'passage: COVID-19 is an emerging disease of public health concern. While there is no specific recommended treatment for COVID-19, nitric oxide has the potential to be of therapeutic value for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. However, inhaled nitric oxide has not yet been formally evaluated. Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.',

However, after an initial period of hybridization, reproductive isolation can evolve through different processes and lead to the interruption of gene flow and the completion of the speciation process. Omocestus minutissimus and O. uhagonii are two closely related grasshoppers with partially overlapping distributions in the Central System mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide SNP data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogen...</code> | <code>passage: BACKGROUND: Human spillovers of SARS-CoV-2 to dogs and the emergence of a highly contagious avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus have raised concerns towards the role of dogs in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and their susceptibility to existing human and avian influenza viruses which might result in further reassortment. METHODS: We systematically studied the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, influenza A viruses of H1, H3, H5, H7 and H9 subtypes and influenza B viruses of Yamagata-like and Victoria-like lineages in ex-vivo canine nasal cavity (NC), soft palate (SP), trachea (T) and lung (L) tissue explant cultures and examined ACE2 and sialic acid (SA) receptor distribution in these tissues. RESULTS: There was limited productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in canine NC and SARS-CoV in canine NC, SP and L with unexpectedly high ACE2 levels in canine NC and SP. Meanwhile, the canine tissues were susceptible to a wide range of human and avian influenza viruses, which mat...</code> |
  | <code>query: A recent study reveals intricate lipidomics patterns involving #omega3/6 and recognized/unidentified #sarscov2 facilitators/receptors. "Our findings underscore the significance of consuming a diet rich in omega-3 to regulate the host inflammatory response in sarscov-2 infection."</code> | <code>passage: Cell surface receptor-mediated viral entry plays a critical role in this infection. Well-established SARS-CoV-2 receptors such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. In fact, there are evidences that SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells from the digestive system. However, emerging research has identified novel mediators such as DPP9, TYK2, and CCR2, all playing a critical role in inflammation. We evaluated the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in peripheral leukocytes (n=469), jejunum (n=30), and colon (n=37) of three independent cohorts by real-time PCR, RNA-sequencing, and microarray transcriptomics. We also performed HPCL-MS/MS lipidomics and metabolomics analyses to identify signatures linked to SARS-CoV-2 receptors. We found markedly higher peripheral leukocytes ACE2 expression levels in women compared to men, whereas the intestinal expression of TMPRSS2 was positively associated with BMI. Consistent lipidomics signatures associated with t...</code> | <code>passage: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cities particularly hard. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19–attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical cons...</code> |
